Description: knitauthors compiles authors and institutional affiliations and
  numbers and formats them ready for inclusion in a (scientific) manuscript.
  During manuscript drafting and revision it may be necessary to add authors
  to a manuscript, requiring that the entire author list needs to be renumbered:
  which can in turn prove labour-intensive and error-prone.
